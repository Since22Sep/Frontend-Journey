<!-- 
   How JavaScript works?
 - Everything in Js happens inside an "execution context"

  Execution context has two component:-
  1) memory component[variable environment] - This is the place where all the variables and functions are stored as key value pairs
  2) code component[Thread of execution] - This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

  Note - Js is a synchronous single-threaded language

  - Single threaded language means Js can execute once command at a time
  - Synchronous single threaded means Js can execute one command at a time in specific order.
